**Tayte Boss**

## Initialise
Simply clone this repo and run 'npm install' then 'npm start' to start the application.

## NodeJS Version
Please ensure you're running Node version: 12.13.0

## Notes
Here I'll talk about my webpack/babel config and other things like hooks/sass/testing. Should I frame this in a way where I try explain what I learnt and implemented?
